Question: How is vulnerability scanning different from penetration testing?
Answer: {"answer":"How is vulnerability scanning different from penetration testing?\nYou could say vulnerability scanning is the same as penetration testing. Both are about identifying risks and weaknesses in a system. But in order to do so, you need to know what is vulnerable in the system and what is not. The purpose of vulnerability scanning is to identify vulnerabilities in a system that are not obvious to the users, and which are hard to detect through penetration testing.\nVulnerability scanning is a method of security testing that uses human testing to identify vulnerabilities in a system.\nPenetration testing, on the other hand, is"}
